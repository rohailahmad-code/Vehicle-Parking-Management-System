Vehicle Parking Management System

## Introduction

Parking management is an ongoing problem in many cities and towns, and with the increase in vehicle ownership, the problem is only becoming more acute. 
The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, user-friendly automated car parking system that addresses the issue of parking management. 
The system aims to reduce manpower and traffic congestion, offer safe and secure parking slots within a limited area, and charge vehicles differently 
based on their specifications and the time spent in the parking lot.

## Objectives

*	Develop an automated car parking system that reduces manpower and traffic congestion
*	Offer safe and secure parking slots within a limited area
*	Charge vehicles differently based on their specifications and the time spent in the parking lot
*	Keep track of the total number of parking spaces available, the number of vehicles currently parked, and the remaining spaces

## Methodology

The program will be developed using C++ programming concepts such as cout, cin, conditions, statements, loops, file handling, and operators. 
The program will include options for vehicle entry, parking on a full-day or hourly basis, vehicle exit. The data of vehicles will be permanently 
stored in files so that it can be retrieved in case of system shutdown.

## Implementation

The program will print a menu upon startup and allow the user to select the type of vehicle. Once the vehicle type has been selected, the program will 
ask for the vehicle's number and vehicle type. The program will also ask whether the vehicle will be parked for a full day or on an hourly basis, and 
will charge accordingly. The program will also include a vehicle exit option, in which the user will be prompted to enter the vehicle's number and 
vehicleâ€™s type. The program will also display the total number of parking spaces available, the number of vehicles currently parked, and the remaining spaces.

## Evaluation

The program will be tested for its ability to accurately keep track of the total number of parking spaces available, the number of vehicles currently parked, 
and the remaining spaces. The program will also be tested for its ability to accurately calculate charges for vehicles based on their specifications and the 
time spent in the parking lot.


## Conclusion

The Vehicles Parking Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing parking spaces and reducing the problems associated with parking management. 
The system utilizes advanced programming concepts and features such as automated vehicle entry and exit, flexible charging options based on vehicle specifications 
and parking duration, and a user-friendly interface for easy operation. The system also includes a data storage feature to ensure that the information is not 
lost in case of system shutdown. The program will be thoroughly tested to ensure its accuracy in tracking parking spaces and calculating charges. Overall, 
this system aims to increase efficiency and provide a convenient parking experience for users while reducing traffic congestion and manpower requirements.
